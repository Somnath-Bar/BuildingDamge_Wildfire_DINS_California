# BuildingDamage_Wildfire_DINS_California

This project investigates the impact of wildfires on building structural damage across California using a comprehensive, data-driven framework. Leveraging over 100,000 CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) records from 2013 to 2024, we integrate environmental, structural, and exposure factors to predict wildfire-induced building damage.  

The framework combines statistical modeling, causal analysis, and machine learning to identify key drivers of damage and assess community vulnerability in wildfire-prone landscapes. The goal is to provide insights for risk mitigation, urban planning, and improving resilience in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas.

All data processing and analysis codes are included in this repository, along with the datasets used for processing.
